# 📊 Credit Data - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a financial dataset related to consumer loan applications. The goal is to uncover patterns, identify potential risks, and help make informed lending decisions.

## 🧾 Problem Statement

When a consumer finance company receives a loan application, it must decide whether to approve the loan based on the applicant’s profile. Two major risks are associated with this decision:

- ❌ **Risk of Not Approving Creditworthy Applicants**
- ⚠️ **Risk of Approving Loans to Potential Defaulters**

The data provided contains information about loan applications at the time of applying. It includes two key types of clients:

- **Clients with payment difficulties**: Those who had late payments exceeding X days on at least one of the first Y instalments.
- **All other clients**: Those who paid on time.

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to **identify the key features** that distinguish applicants who are likely to **repay the loan** from those who are likely to **default**. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we reveal insights hidden in the data to assist lending companies in making more informed and accurate decisions.
